# memory-game

This is a memory game for kids, developed with html, css and jQuery, so it's pretty vanilla. 
This game has been built keeping in mind that this is a kids game, developed specifically to help my girlfriend, whose a support teacher, in her job.
The game allows you to choose how many pairs of cards you want, so you can choose the right difficulty.  

The app is hosted with Google Firebase and is available at this url:
